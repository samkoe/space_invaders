# Space Invaders Clone with Python 3 Turtle Graphics

This is a project written originally by Christian Thompson (http://christianthompson.com/node/45) in Python 2. I've rewritten it in Python 3 and added a few tweaks.

Thompson has a fantastic video tutorial series on his website (and YouTube). This is a great project for students who are familiar with the basics functions and methods of the Python Turtle module.

This project shows how to use multiple turtles, to create simple animations, to set up boundary checking and collision checking, and how to import custom turtle shapes and custom sounds.
